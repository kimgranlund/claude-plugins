# Best Practices — Control Patterns (/goal, /loop, and the continuation plane)

How to drive autonomous work without conflating selection and control. Assumes `foundations.md`. Scored by `rubric.md`. Version-sensitive mechanics are marked `△ verify against your build`.

## The continuation plane

These patterns decide *when the next turn fires*, not *what runs on it*. Discovery (description-matching) handles selection underneath, every turn. Do not expect any continuation pattern to "find the right agents and skills" — that is always-on behavior, orthogonal to the goal.

| Pattern | Job | Control mode |
|---|---|---|
| `/goal` | Run until a verifiable condition holds | Objective |
| `/loop` | Re-run a prompt on a timer (polling) | Objective (recurring) |
| Auto mode | Approve tool calls automatically | — |
| Stop hook (exit 2) | Force continued work until a check passes | Objective (enforced) |
| Agent team | Self-coordinating, long-running | Mission |

## /goal — objective-driven autonomy

`/goal` sets a completion condition and keeps working toward it without per-step prompting. After each turn a separate fast evaluator model reads the transcript and answers met / not-met; if not met, another turn starts. `△ requires a recent build (v2.1.139+); one active goal per session.`

The condition is a one-line rubric, and its quality is the whole game:

- **Verifiable end-state, not process.** Name a measurable condition with a stated proof: "`pnpm test` exits 0," "every call site compiles," not "the code is clean."
- **Self-evidencing.** The evaluator judges only what the agent has surfaced in the transcript — it does not run commands or read files itself. The proof must land in the conversation, or the gate is judging vapor. And the proof is raw command output, not the agent's claim about it — "tests pass" is a claim; the runner's output is evidence. When enforcement matters, escalate to a Stop hook + deterministic check.
- **Bounded.** Append a cap ("or stop after 25 turns") so an unmeetable goal cannot run forever.
- **Escalating, not retrying.** The cap is a backstop, not a strategy: the same condition failing twice on identical evidence indicts the goal or its spec, not the worker's effort. Encode the branch in the goal text — "if the same check fails twice in a row, stop and report the blocker" — so the run ends on a decision, never on a dead budget.

## /loop — polling, not finishing

`/loop` re-runs a prompt on an interval. Use it to monitor external state that changes ("check the build status; alert on failure"). Putting `/loop` on work with a finish line burns turns re-running a completed job; putting `/goal` on external state spins because the condition is not the agent's to move. `△ /loop may be built-in or a custom command in .claude/commands/ depending on build — verify.`

## Stop hooks — enforced continuation

When you need "do not finish until X," a Stop hook that exits 2 makes the agent read stderr and keep working. This is the enforced form of an objective: the harness, not the model, decides the run is not done. Pair it with a deterministic check (lint, tests) so "X" is real.

## Auto mode — the approval plane, not a continuation pattern

Auto mode approves tool calls automatically; its control-mode cell above is "—" because it decides *who approves each call*, never when the next turn fires. It composes with the real continuation patterns rather than competing with them: an autonomous `/goal` or Stop-hook run usually needs it — and once the human approval gate is gone, the goal's cap, scope guard, and escalation clause are the only brakes left. An unbounded goal in auto mode has no brakes at all: bound it first. `△ the approval-mode name and toggle vary by build — verify.`

## Loops that delegate

A goal loop that dispatches subagents is an orchestrated system, and a flat turn cap stops being enough — the canon is `self-orchestrated-looping-agentic-systems.md`; the load-bearing rules:

- **Budgets are hierarchical and enforced at spawn.** The run cap decomposes into per-task budgets stated in each dispatch and a bounded repair-attempt count per finding. A delegate that doesn't know its budget has none — it is enforced only by surprise.
- **Continuation is a decision, not a default.** Each cycle ends by choosing from a closed set — advance | repair(locus) | replan | escalate | halt(done) | halt(budget) — encoded in the goal text or enforced at a Stop-hook decision point. "Not met → go again" is momentum, not control.
- **Escalate the locus on repeat failure.** Attempt 1 repairs the artifact; the same finding twice makes the spec suspect — route the repair upstream; a third failure is a replan or a halt. Oscillating findings, a findings count that won't decrease, or turns burning without frontier movement force the decision immediately.
- **Durable state lives outside the transcript.** A loop meant to survive a session records plan state, verdicts, and budget spend in files it can resume from — the transcript is volatile by design.

## Right-pattern selection

- Finish-line work the agent can prove → `/goal`.
- Recurring check of external state → `/loop`.
- Hard "keep going until clean" → Stop hook + a check.
- Parallel work needing discussion → agent team (mission mode).
- One scoped delegation returning a result → subagent (not a control pattern; see orchestration).

## Do

- Write goals as verifiable end-states with the proof method named.
- Make the proof land in the transcript.
- Bound every goal with a turn/time cap.
- Add an escalation clause: repeated identical failures revise the goal/spec or halt — never spend the cap on flat retries.
- Use `/loop` for polling, `/goal` for finish-lines.
- Keep selection (discovery) and continuation separate when debugging.

## Don't

- Expect `/goal` to select skills or agents.
- Give the evaluator a condition it cannot read from the conversation ("make it elegant").
- Use `/goal` to poll external state, or `/loop` for finite work.
- Treat the worker's self-assessment as the gate — use the separate evaluator or a check.
- Accept "tests pass" prose as proof — require the raw command output in the transcript.

## Best-in-class example

```
/goal every call site of the old billing API is migrated to v2, `pnpm test`
exits 0, and `pnpm lint` is clean — prove each by showing command output;
do not modify unrelated test files; if the same check fails twice in a row,
stop and report the blocker; or stop after 25 turns
```

Measurable end-state, three checkable conditions, surfaced proof, a scope guard, an escalation clause, and a bound. The agent will route to whatever skills and subagents each step triggers — discovery does that — while the goal only decides when to stop.
