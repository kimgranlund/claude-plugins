"""potency_lint.py — mechanical triage for linguistic anti-patterns in a prompt artifact.

Surfaces the SURFACE-LEVEL smells that are regex-detectable — prohibition density (§5),
vague quantifiers and salience inflation (§8), and hedges (§4/§11). It is triage, not a
verdict: it cannot see whether a line *instantiates* or merely *describes* (that is the
[review] judgment, L1). Fenced ``` code blocks are skipped, but prose examples and
counter-examples will still trip it — read the flagged lines, don't obey the count.

Subject-noun exclusion (2026-07-04): an artifact whose OWN name contains a word in the
vague-quantifier set (a skill about writing *briefs* trips `brief`) would be permanently
red on that category through no fault of its prose — proven live by a real-artifact
shakedown (15/16 hits on one file were its own subject noun). The vague check therefore
skips exact-word matches of the artifact's own name tokens (frontmatter `name:`, the
bundle dir for a SKILL.md, or the file stem). Derived forms still count — `briefly`
flags even when the subject is `brief`.

Usage:  python3 potency_lint.py <file>
        python3 potency_lint.py selftest   # fixture-locked proof of the counters
Exit 0 = every category within budget.  Exit 1 = at least one budget exceeded.
