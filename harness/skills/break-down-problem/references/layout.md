# Domain: Layout — manifest adapter

> `break-down-problem` domain reference — **canon for this domain in this pack**: the two axis
> ladders (frame → regions → groups → atoms; feature-actions → bindings → surfaces), the justify
> values, and the manifest mapping below — for the case where a layout decomposition feeds a
> downstream PRD/SPEC/LLD as a verified manifest. This adapter deliberately carries no archetype

> live UI design/critique (a screenshot, mockup, or wireframe to grade, not a manifest to feed
> forward), route to `ui:break-down-layout` instead — its archetype library, leveled A1-B5 rubric,
> and dedicated `layout-checker` critic are a different mechanism serving a different consumer,
> not a deeper version of this one (corrected 2026-07-19: this line previously called that pack
> "retired," which was stale — it is alive and is the deliberate landing spot for that need).

## Mapping to the manifest

- **nodes** (OUTSIDE-IN) — the macro→micro tree: frame, regions, groups, atoms
  become nodes; the smallest placed units are `leaf: true`.
- **actions** (INSIDE-OUT) — the feature-actions (what the user does here); the
  bindings and surfaces levels are how you *decide* a `hosts` row, not separate manifest entries.
- **hosts** — each feature-action → the region/atom that makes it reachable.
- **justify** values for an action-free leaf: `content`, `affordance`, `spacing`.

## Cross-check (defect quadrant)

- Every feature-action must host on a region or atom → else `UNHOSTED` (the screen can't do it).
- Every leaf atom must host an action **or** carry a `justify` → else `UNJUSTIFIED-LEAF` (decoration).

## Worked manifest (a sign-in screen)

Map: `recover password` finds no node → `UNHOSTED` → add a `recovery-link` atom under `main`.
Re-check → clean.

```json
{
  "domain": "layout",
  "nodes": [
    {"id":"main","label":"main"},
    {"id":"creds","label":"credentials-group"},
    {"id":"submit","label":"submit-button","leaf":true},
    {"id":"recover","label":"recovery-link","leaf":true}
  ],
  "actions": [
    {"id":"email","label":"enter email"},
    {"id":"pass","label":"enter password"},
    {"id":"go","label":"submit"},
    {"id":"recoverpw","label":"recover password"}
  ],
  "hosts": [
    {"action":"email","node":"creds"},{"action":"pass","node":"creds"},
    {"action":"go","node":"submit"},{"action":"recoverpw","node":"recover"}
  ]
}
```
